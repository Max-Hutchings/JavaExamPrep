# Working With Java Operators

## Operators

Arithmetic Operators:

* \+ - addition
* \- - subtraction
* \* - multiplication
* / - division
* % - Modulo (remainder)

Relational Operators - used for comparing against other values or against literals:

* ==
* !=
* \>
* \>=
* <
* <=

An if statement (using logical operators) isn't really considered an expression apparently.

## Ternary Operator

A conditional operator - **? :** - used to evaluate Boolean expressions that return a value, used to set a value to a variable. Cannot be used as an expression itself, must be in the form:

```java
int larger = (a > b) ? a : b; //if true, set larger to a, else set larger to b 
```
