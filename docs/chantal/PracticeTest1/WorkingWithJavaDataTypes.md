# Working with Java Data Types

## Primitive Data Types

int range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1

- it is signed, so the first bit is reserved for the sign
- in SE 8 and later, can be used to represent unsigned int from 0 to 2^32 - 1
- Integer.MIN_VALUE = -2^31
- Integer.MAX_VALUE = 2^31 - 1

## Variables

Local variables need to be initialised before use/any reference. Static variables can be accessed through the class or instance reference.
