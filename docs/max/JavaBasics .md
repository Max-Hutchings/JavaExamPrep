# Java Basics
### Main(String[] args)

```java

//    How do declare main method
    public static void main(String[] args){}

//      The order of public, static and final doesnt matter
    static public void main(String[] args){}

//      "Final" prevents the method from being over riden
    final public static void main(String[] args){}

```
- The main method must be public 
- Return type should always be before method name 
- Return type must always be present 
- Main method will only run if return type is void.
- e.g. a main method that returns will not run

### Access modifiers 
1. Public: available to any class
2. private: available to itself 
3. protected: available to itself and subclasses

### Encapsulation 
1. Data stored in fields can be controlled by the class easily
2. Read only / write only data can be defined in a class

### Polymorphism 
Subclasses from a super() class. 
1. Reusability 
2. Flexibility 

### OOP
1. Inheritance 
2. Encapsulation
3. Abstraction

### Java characteristics
1. Does NOT support operator overloading. The same opporator cannot behave differently depending on types.
2. Java does NOT support "goto". There are no jumpts to another part of the coed.
3. Java does NOT support pointers. Java uses references which are similar but more restrictive.
4. Java is platform indepedent.
5. Java converts source code to bytecode at compilation time.
