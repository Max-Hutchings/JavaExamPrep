# What Is Java?
### Features of Java
1. **Portability:** Java is platform-independent, meaning that code compiled on one platform can run on any other platform that has a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
2. **Exception Handling**: Java provides robust exception handling mechanisms, allowing developers to catch and handle runtime errors systematically to prevent program termination.
3. **Security**: Java is designed with several built-in security features such as bytecode verification, sandboxing, and access control, making it a secure choice for developing applications.
4. **Flexible namespace**: Java's namespace system allows classes to be organized in packages, preventing naming conflicts and enhancing code organization.


### NOT features of java 
1. **Pointers:** java uses references which is similar but more restrictive.
2. **Operator Overloading:** programming languages that allows different operations to be performed depending on the type of the operands. For example, in C++, the + operator can be used to add two numbers, concatenate two strings, or merge two lists, depending on the types of the operands.
